The requested output fields can be determined as described above, and as in CMIP5, the data must be \u201ccmorized\u201d (i.e., written in conformance with all the CMIP standards). The CMIP standards build on the CF-conventions, which define metadata that provide a description of the variables and their spatial and temporal properties. This facilitates analysis of the data by users who can read and interpret data from all models in the same way.</p> <p>As described in section 6, it is recommended, but not required, that the CMOR software library be used to rewrite model output in conformance with the standards. In any case to ensure that a critical subset of the requirements have been met, a CMIP data checker (\"PrePARE\") will be applied before data are placed in the CMIP6 data archive.</p> <p>The CMIP6 data requirements are defined and discussed in the following documents:</p> <ul> <li>Definition of CMIP6 netCDF global attributes</li> <li>Reference \u201ccontrolled vocabularies\u201d (CV\u2019s) for CMIP6</li> <li>Specifications for file names, directory structures,  and CMIP6 Data Reference Syntax (DRS)</li> <li>Specifications for output file content, structure, and metadata are available in draft google doc.

Many of these are recognized by CMOR (through input via the CMIP6 CMOR Tables), which will ensure compliance.</p> <p>Note that in the above, controlled vocabularies (CV\u2019s) play a key role in ensuring uniformity in the description of data sets across all models. For all but variable-specific information, reference CV\u2019s are being maintained by PCMDI against which all quality assurance checks will be performed. These CV\u2019s will be relied on in constructing file names and directory structures, and they will enable faceted searches of the CMIP6 archive as called for in the search requirements document. Additional, variable-specific CVs are part of the CMIP6 Data Request. These CV\u2019s are structured in a way that makes clear relationships between certain items appearing in separate CV\u2019s. For example, the CV for model names (\u201csource_id\u201d) indicates which institutions are authorized to run each model, and the complete list of institutions is recorded in a CV for \u201cinstitution_id\u201d.</p> <p>As indicated in the guidance specifications for output grids, weights should be provided to regrid all output to a few standard grids (e.g., 1x1 degree).

Specifications for the required standard format will be forthcoming.</p> <p>CMIP6 output requirements that are critical for successful ingestion and access via ESGF will be enforced when publication of the data is initiated. The success of CMIP6 depends on making sure that even the requirements that can not be checked by ESGF are met. This is the responsibility of anyone preparing model output for CMIP6.

This package was first used in CMIP3 and has been generalized and improved for each new CMIP phase. Use of CMOR is not mandatory, but past experience suggests that many common errors in model output files can be avoided by its use.</p> <p>For those not using CMOR, some checks for compliance with CMIP specifications can be performed using a new code developed in support of CMIP6: the Pre-Publication Attribute Reviewer for ESGF (PrePARE). For information about tests performed by PrePARE, view the design requirements. PrePARE is included as part of the CMOR software suite and all files produced by CMOR are effectively checked by PrePARE, but PrePARE can be invoked without using CMOR to write the output.</p> <p>In addition to PrePARE, tests for file compliance with the CF-conventions can be made using a tool called the CF-checker. Both PrePARE and the CF-checker will be run as part of the ESGF publication job stream, and only files passing all tests will be published and made available for download.</p> <p>It should be noted if data are written using CMOR, additional checks will be performed that will, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Guarantee that the metadata associated with each variable is recorded in the  file (PrePARE only checks some of the variable attributes)</li> <li>Check for monotonicity of a coordinate values</li> <li>Check for \"gaps\" in the time coordinates</li> <li>Check that coordinates are stored in the right direction (and for the longitude coordinate check that the range is correct)</li> <li>Check that data values are within limits specified in the cmor tables (but for  most variables, this won't happen since limits are yet to be defined)</li> </ul> <p>Additional codes useful in preparing model output for CMIP6 include:</p> <ul> <li>Code to create regridding weights: not yet available</li> <li> <p>Code to calculate nominal_resolution: For the common case of a regular spherical coordinate (latitude x longitude) global grid, the nominal_resolution can be calculated using a formula given in Appendix 2 of the CMIP6 netCDF global attributes document.

Certain ESGF data nodes (known as \u201cTier 1 nodes\u201d) will serve as the primary access points to the data.

The data provider (modeling center) will need to closely coordinate and cooperate with the ESGF data manager(s) of a specific ESGF data node site. Here is a summary of the main steps and requirements in the procedure:</p> <ul> <li>CMIP6 data compliance checking: Before data are passed to the data node for  publication, modeling centers should check that it is in conformance with all  the output requirements outlined in the sections above</li> <li>Selection of an ESGF data node: Modeling centers can either set up and host  their own ESGF data node or engage with an existing ESGF node. In either case  certain rules must be followed as outlined in the \"ESGF Data Node Managers and Operators\"  guide. If the node hosting the data has not been designated \u201cTier 1\u201d, then one  of the Tier 1 nodes will have to be selected to serve as the publication site.  Improperly configured data nodes will not be accessible through the federated  ESGF system</li> <li>Data transfer and ESGF data management: In addition to putting in place a  procedure for smoothly transferring and publishing CMIP6 data, a clearly defined  process for handling corrections to flawed data should be established. This would  include a formal procedure for recording \u201cerrata\u201d information in the case of correction  and replacement of erroneous data</li> <li>Data publication: The ESGF data node managers are responsible for ESGF data  publication and storage as described more completely in the \"ESGF Data Node Managers and Operators\"  guide. Publication of data not meeting the minimal CMIP6 data quality requirements  will be blocked</li> <li>Data replication: Some of the Tier 1 nodes plan to replicate some of the  data published by other nodes. This will provide some redundancy across the federation  protecting against loss of at least some of the data in the event of a catastrophic  storage failure at one node. It will also provide a backup source of data when  one node is temporarily offline. Not all data will be replicated, so it is recommended  that modeling groups retain a backup copy of their model output</li> <li>Data access: After data publication the CMIP6 data (as well as associated  errata information, documentation and citation information) will be visible and  accessible via the following designated CMIP6 data portals: PCMDI,  DKRZ, IPSL, CEDA, and others</li> <li>Data long-term archival: A \u201csnapshot\u201d of CMIP6 data as it exists at the time  of a deadline imposed by the IPCC\u2019s 6th Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) will be archived  at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC, http://ipcc-data.org)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CMIP7/guidance_for_modellers/#8-documentation-process","title":"8.

ES-DOC provides a variety of tools (script-based, text-based,  and form-based) for gathering this information from modeling groups, allowing  for personal/institutional preference in the way in which documents are created</li> <li>Experimental conformance: Each simulation should  conform to a number of specific requirements established by the MIP leaders. For  example, an experiment may have the requirement that all simulations must start  and end on particular dates. The full set of experimental requirements for each  experiment can be viewed at https://search.es-doc.org.  Sometimes there could be more than one way to meet the requirements, so modeling  groups must record information about how each simulation conforms to the specifications</li> <li>Individual members of an ensemble:. Some ensemble  documentation is harvested by ES-DOC from published netCDF files, but additional  information must be provided by modeling groups directly to ES-DOC.

ES-DOC will therefore  serve as the reference source for understanding differences between ensemble members.  As described in more detail elsewhere (Definition of CMIP6 netCDF global attributes  and ES-DOC for CMIP6), there are 4 indices defining an ensemble  member: \u201cr\u201d for realization, \u201ci\u201d for initialization, \u201cp\u201d for physics, and \u201cf\u201d  for forcing. Modeling groups will record in ES-DOC the key to interpreting the  differences between simulations identified by different indices.
